# Lego:

> I love Legos,  chess and video games. My design is intended to show the evolution of chess, from being a classical board game played with pieces of wood, ivory or marble to a dynamic, blitz style e-sport  played online with clicks in rapid succession. The seemingly humble but always classic Lego brick is at the heart of my idea just as the seemingly powerless pawn can make or break chess strategies. My design is a tribute to the game of chess, which I love and an ode to the amazing versatility of Legos. If you like my idea, you can take a look [here](https://ideas.lego.com/projects/f7806f32-c5f6-4e89-801f-a35996a0881c).

# Origami:

> The beauty of origami is in transforming a 2d sheet of paper into a 3d object, whether it's an animal, plane, geometic object, or anything in between.

> One of the coolest shapes you can make is a hyperbolic parabaloid, which is a shape that shows up in some graphs with 3 axes.
