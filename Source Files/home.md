# **About Me:**

# AI:
The versatility of AI is why I have used it for various projects, like [this program to to turn audio into images](https://github.com/Rockroyal305/SRP-Code). Linear regression particularly fascinates me because of its simplicity and usefulness.

# Chess:
Chess is a game that I have played for a long time. I am [one of the top junior players](https://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?15717696), both in my state and in the country. I am interested in researching the intersections between Chess, AI, Neurology, and Psychology.
